## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval = T}
pkgload::load_all()
dash_data <- load_dash_data()
overview_data <- filter_dash_data(series_ids = c(
                             "A84423349V", # Employed total
                             "A84423355R", # Part rate
                             "A84423354L", # Unemp rate
                             "A84423350C", # Unemp total
                             "A85223451R", # Underut rate
                             "A84426256L", # Hours worked
                             "A85223450L", # Underemp rate
                             "A84423357V", # Emp FT
                             "pt_emp_vic" # Emp PT
                           ))

overview_data %>%
  create_summary_df(for_reactable = FALSE) %>%
  make_briefing_table()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
